## 02_09 Automating The Right Things With Playwright

## 02_10 Challenge: Create 3 Automated Tests

- Challenge: Create 3 Automated Tests

  - Create an automated test that adds an item to the shopping cart, Goes through the checkout process and when paying select buy now pay later.
  - Create a visual test to the checkout flow to validate the final payment screen.
  - Create an API test against the endpoint /products/{unique_id}, ensuring the correct product details are returned.

- Hints:
  - Save yourself some time and utilize the storage state that we have already created in video 02_06.
  - The productIds automatically change every 2 hours, so you will need to find a way to get the current productId reliably for the API test.
